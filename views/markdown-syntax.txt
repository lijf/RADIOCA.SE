Text areas are formatted using [markdown](http://www.daringfireball.net/), created by John Gruber of Daring Fireball fame.

Paragraphs are separated with one or more empty lines. If you put more than one line the rendering won't change (so no creating whitespace this way!) 

If you double-click in this area, you can see (and edit) the markdown source.

# Different levels of 
## headlines are most easily  
### created by putting a number of   
#### hashes (#) at the start of the line, 
corresponding to the 'headline-level' (many hashes - small headline)

1. By using number-period-space (1. ) you can create a numbered list. With the numbers nicely offset to the left and paragraphs lining up.
2. Actually the exact number is irrelevant...
1. The points will always be numbered consequentially

To start a new list you have to interpose at least one line without a number or other special character

* Bulleted lists can be created using an asterisk (*)
* The characters have been chosen so as to make the markdown text easier to read for humans.
* asterisks, or underscore (_) are also used to add *emphasis* to a word (\*emphasis\* or \_emphasis\_), if you surround a word with two asterisks or underscore characters the word becomes **bold** (\*\*bold\*\*)

Control-characters can be escaped with backslash (\\) - which can be useful if you for example want to surround a phrase with \*asterisks without reformatting\* (as I just had to do).

There are two main ways of creating hyperlinks.

1. Either you can enclose the "link-word" with brackets and then put the target and an optional title inside a parenthesis just after it \[google](http://www.google.com, "Google") renders to [google](http://www.google.com "Google").
2. The other option is to use a reference, where you again put the link word in brackets followed by an id in brackets [link][id], then you reference this id on a separate line further down the page like this:

\[id]: http://radiographics.rsna.org/ "Optional title"

An example of a [link with reference][ref]. This has the advantage of moving the literal addresses out of the flow of the source text, they can for example be put at the end of the document.
