Remove case
  Find first page 
    Find nextpage 
      Remove first page
        Find next-next 
          Remove next

          So - this is recursive...

function removecase (firstpage)
  removepage (firstpage) nextpage
    if nextpage
      removecase nextpage


Uploaded stacks don't automatically show - why? error in response or how it is received?
